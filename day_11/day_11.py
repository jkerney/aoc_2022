Advent of Code 2022 - Day 11

Seven monkeys. For each monkey:
- first line is items, each with a worry level
- second line - operation for calculating a new worry level when the monkey
- starts inspecting it
- 3-5 lines - a test that decides which monkey it throws the item to

- After applying new worry level, then divide by three and take floor

- round - all monkeys take a turn
- keep track of how many inspections each monkey does
- monkey business - inspections of top two monkeys multiplied after 20
- rounds

- approach
- for each monkey
    - a list of worry level for each item
    - operation type
    - operation amount
    - test divisible amount
    - true monkey
    - false monkey
- one list for all monkeys
- start with worry level

Part 2
- stop dividing worry by 3
- what is level of monkey business after 10,000 rounds
- problem is the numbers are getting too big...
- if i take modulo of all numbers used in tests, does that give the same
- result? e.g. test 1 is modulo 3, test 2 is modulo 11. 
- number is 98, 98 % 3 = 2, 98 % 11 = 10.
- if we took 98 modulo (3 * 11 = 33), we get 32. 
- 32 % 3 = 2, 32 % 11 = 10.
